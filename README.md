# IT704gitpresentation
A quick demonstration outlining the benefits of version control.
In this directory you'll find a logbook file. The intended purpose
of the demonstration is for participants to clone the repo, this README
and the logbook file included, and add his or her information to the logbook.
The end result will be a logbook with entries from all participants, where
individual contributors only needed to clone the repo, make a change, and push
that change back to the remote repo.
Alternatively, another group will be used to demonstrate more primitive
means of collaboration (be it emailing files, FTP, or physically moving files.)
Ideally, Git's clear advantages will become apparent even from a quick example
such as this.
